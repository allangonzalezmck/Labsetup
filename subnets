The **Edge Overlay** subnet is a critical part of the NSX-T architecture. Its primary function is to enable communication between the NSX-T Edge nodes and the NSX-T Manager and controllers. This communication is necessary for the proper functioning of overlay networking, which is a key feature in NSX-T for enabling micro-segmentation, dynamic routing, and advanced networking features.

### Functions of the Edge Overlay Subnet:

1. **Overlay Networking:**
   - The Edge Overlay subnet is used by the Edge nodes for establishing tunnels (VTEPs - Virtual Tunnel Endpoints) with other transport nodes (ESXi hosts, other Edge nodes). These tunnels encapsulate the traffic and allow it to be transported across the physical network infrastructure.

2. **East-West Traffic:**
   - In a virtualized environment, east-west traffic refers to the traffic between virtual machines within the data center. The Edge Overlay subnet helps in routing this traffic efficiently across different segments of the network.

3. **North-South Traffic:**
   - Edge nodes also handle north-south traffic, which is the traffic entering or leaving the data center. The overlay network ensures that this traffic is routed correctly through the physical network to its destination.

4. **High Availability and Redundancy:**
   - By utilizing an overlay network, NSX-T ensures that the network remains resilient and can reroute traffic in case of failures or changes in the physical network topology. The Edge Overlay subnet is integral to maintaining this high availability.

5. **Dynamic Routing:**
   - Edge nodes use the Edge Overlay subnet for dynamic routing protocols like BGP and OSPF. These protocols help in efficiently managing the routes within the network and ensuring optimal path selection for traffic.

6. **Micro-Segmentation:**
   - The overlay network allows for micro-segmentation, which is the ability to create isolated segments within the network at the virtual machine level. This enhances security by ensuring that only authorized traffic can move between segments.
