Logical Design
1. Spine-Leaf Network Architecture
Spine Switches: Connect the leaf switches. They act as the backbone of the network, providing high-speed interconnects.
Leaf Switches: Connect the compute and storage nodes to the spine switches. Each leaf switch should have redundant connections to both spine switches.
2. VMware VCF Suite Integration
Management Domain: Deploy the management components of VMware VCF on a set of management hosts.
Workload Domains: Use the 4 blades for different workload domains, with appropriate network segments and VLANs configured on the leaf switches.
3. Compute Layer (Blades for Virtualization)
Blades: Each blade should have redundant network connections to both leaf switches for high availability.
VMware ESXi Hosts: Install ESXi on the blades and configure them into clusters managed by vCenter, which is part of the VCF suite.
4. Storage Layer
Pure Storage: Connect Pure Storage to the leaf switches, ensuring redundant paths for high availability and performance.
Flash Hardware: Similarly, connect flash hardware to the leaf switches for additional storage options.
Detailed Steps
Spine Switch Configuration:

Configure the spine switches with appropriate routing protocols (e.g., BGP or OSPF).
Ensure high-speed interconnects (e.g., 40/100 Gbps links) between spine and leaf switches.
Leaf Switch Configuration:

Configure VLANs for different segments (management, vMotion, storage, workload).
Ensure each leaf switch has redundant uplinks to both spine switches.
Configure port channels for connections to blades and storage devices.
Compute Blade Configuration:

Install and configure VMware ESXi on each blade.
Connect each blade to both leaf switches using redundant NICs.
Add the blades to the appropriate VCF workload domains.
Storage Configuration:

Connect Pure Storage and flash hardware to the leaf switches.
Configure multipathing for storage devices to ensure redundancy and performance.
Integrate storage with VMware vSphere, ensuring datastores are accessible to all ESXi hosts.
VMware VCF Suite Deployment:

Deploy the VCF management components on a subset of the blades.
Use VMware Cloud Foundation to manage the entire setup, including network, compute, and storage resources.
